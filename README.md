Simulating and researching the prisoners dilemma study. Based on algoritmic design of different approaches to the game at hand, scores across 10,000+ games of the Prisoner's Dilemmma will return different results each time the game is simulated as shown in the images below (and results attached as a .csv file in the Git repo).
